# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose was to learn how to call an API, such as OpenWeatherMap or Google Maps, to do the following:

1. Retreive Weather Data

The weather data was used to create a dataframe for the hotel search which created the destinations map below.

2. Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

The map below was provided to display cities that met the travelers inputted search parameters.
